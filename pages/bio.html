          <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
          As you probably could have guessed, my name is Eric Bailey. I'm a junior at Tufts University up in Boston, MA, but originally from South Carolina.</p>
          <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
          Academically, you can see what I'm into from my resume--so let's use this space to illustrate something meaningful. I'm into running, <a href="http://jakeandamir.com">Jake and Amir</a>, learning new things, the Internet, being fast at typing with Vim, and shooting clays. One of these things I'm not quite able to do while at school since there's no team, no guns, or clay fields. But other than that, just generally having a great time!</p>
